# Vax-Man

Inspired by the [EA Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/x4KPrqxMDS4a5isKe/EA-Software-Engineering-Virtual-Experience-Program), I have begun creating the game Vax-Man as a variation on the well-known game of Pac-Man. In Vax-Man, the ghosts are killed by Vax-Man. However, the number of ghosts doubles every 30 seconds, and if there become 128 or more ghosts before all dots are collected, it's game over! I am using this as an opportunity to learn a few different programming libraries for creating basic games, though my primary interest is in learning Unreal Engine and Unity.

## Python Implementation

Modifying the implementation of Pac-Man provided in [this Github](https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman) and after having learned the basics of [PyGame](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/), the attached Python implementation of Vax-Man has been provided.

## C++ Implementation

The C++ Implementation is a modified version of the [implementation of Pac-Man by Patricia Terol](https://github.com/patriciateroltolsa/Pacman/blob/master/assign10.cpp). The implementation uses [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/).

## Future Implementations

I have not spent much time on the previous two implementations since I wished for most of my focus to be on learning and using Unreal Engine. An implementation in Unreal Engine is forthcoming.
